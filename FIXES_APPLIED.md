## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Testing:
1. **Run with Python optimization**
   ```bash
   python -O train_script.py
   ```
   Should work without errors now.

2. **Test gradient checkpointing**
   ```python
   # With PyTorch 1.10 or 1.11
   model = create_mswr_base(use_checkpoint=True)
   # Train a few steps and check memory usage
   ```

3. **Test NaN handling**
   ```python
   # CSWIN v2 should log warnings if NaN detected
   # Check that memory usage is lower
   ```

4. **Test edge cases**
   ```python
   # Test with batch_size=1, small images, large images
   # Test with different channel counts
   ```

### Full Test Suite:
Run the complete test suite from [AUDIT_SUMMARY.md](AUDIT_SUMMARY.md) to verify:
